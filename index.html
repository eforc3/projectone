  <p>Since January 2022, rates of homelessness in New York City have increased by an unprecedented 70%. The causes of this crisis are varied and complex, and the city has never faced a challenge like this before.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>In the beginning of 2022, due to pandemic housing efforts and COVID-19 eviction protections, rates of homelessness were the lowest they have been in years, at a little over 50,000 people. Since then, however, due to various factors, homelessness has jumped to an all time record of 85,000 individuals. </p>

  <h3 class="exp"> Spiking Homelessness </h3>
  <p class="tag"> The previous record for homelessness was around 64,000 individuals back in 2019. In the years leading up to 2019, homelessness was increasing at a fairly steady rate of around one to two thousand individuals per year. Between 2019 and the start of 2022, homelessness dropped to 50,000 individuals, but since then it has spiked to over 85,000. The city went from an increase of 1-2 thousand homeless per year to an average increase of nearly 2,000 per month since January 2022. </p>

  <h3 class="exp"> Causes of Homelessness </h3>
  <p class="tag"> In the beginning of 2022, homelessness was at an artificially low number because of pandemic era policies, but those policies were ending. Even before the migrant crisis which began in the Spring, rates of homelessness were climbing far more rapidly than average; there was an increase of around 1,000 homeless between February and March 2022. Between inflation, rising rents, and the end of eviction protection, NYC was already poised for a rapid return to pre-pandemic levels of homelessness, but the influx of nearly 120,000 migrants in 20 months has left the city’s infrastructure reeling and caused homelessness to jump far past the previous record. </p>

  <h3 class="exp"> Struggling Infrastructure </h3>
  <p class="tag"> The sheer number of individuals arriving and the speed at which they have been doing so has been straining city services. The Department of Homeless Services kept pace with the crisis for quite a while; in a single month it expanded its homeless shelters by a remarkable 5,000 beds. But even the DHS has reached its limit, and the city has been building alternate locations to place homeless migrants, like the tent city at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens. If the infrastructure for temporary housing has reached its limit, then public programs for permanent housing cannot hope to keep up with the rise of homelessness. New York City’s section 8 program, which offers a crucial step in escaping homelessness, is the largest in the country, but it still only has 85,000 vouchers available in total, and much of them are already distributed. </p>

  <h3 class="exp"> Housing Crisis </h3>
  <p class="tag"> The existing lack of affordable housing is all the more apparent with the influx of migrants. Rents are at a record high in NYC, with the average rent rising to over $5,000 in Manhattan and the median price for a one bedroom apartment rising to over $4,000 across the city. Meanwhile, NYC also has the lowest number of affordable apartments available since 1991, with less than one percent of apartments priced for middle to low income ($1,500 or less) being vacant. This has led to longer stays in homeless shelters and lower rates of escape from homelessness. The rate of people rising out of homelessness has decreased as the overall number of homeless has increased. </p>
